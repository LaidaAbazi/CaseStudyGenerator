AI: Take your time.
USER: Uh, they So... For me, can you explain this more? Can you simplify the question?

When the user, which is the client who wants to generate a case study, document and our AI voice agent is going to do a conversation where the AI voice agent is going to get enough information and generate a case, their case study document based on that conversation they realized previously. So I'll move this only in 10 minutes.
AI: That's impressive! So, it sounds like Case Study Gen streamlines the process by having a voice agent gather the necessary information and then generate the case study document in just ten minutes. How did Tactica respond to this new tool? Were there any specific features they found particularly useful?

AI: It sounds like the
USER: Maybe integrating a voice agent was more complex than we thought.
AI: I see, so integrating the voice agent was a bit challenging. Integration can often have those complexities. How did you and your team overcome this to make the rollout successful?
