Aida's team worked closely with Eos to understand their specific needs and ensure the tool met their expectations. There were several iterations and feedback sessions to fine-tune the tool's performance. The experience underlined the importance of open communication and iterative development when delivering AI solutions.\n\n**Section 4 - Results & Impact**\n\nThe impact of the Case Study Generator on Eos's operations has been significant. Though exact metrics weren't provided, it's clear that this tool has streamlined their case study creation process, saving them considerable time and resources.
